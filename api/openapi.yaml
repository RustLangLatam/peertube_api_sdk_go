    The PeerTube API is built on HTTP(S) and is RESTful. You can use your favorite
    HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use PeerTube. The spec API is fully compatible with
    [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/wiki/API-client-generator-HOWTO)
    which generates a client SDK in the language of your choice - we generate some client SDKs automatically:

    - [Python](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/python)
    - [Go](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/go)
    - [Kotlin](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/kotlin)

    See the [REST API quick start](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-getting-started) for a few
    examples of using the PeerTube API.

    # Authentication

    When you sign up for an account on a PeerTube instance, you are given the possibility
    to generate sessions on it, and authenticate there using an access token. Only __one
    access token can currently be used at a time__.

    ## Roles

    Accounts are given permissions based on their role. There are three roles on
    PeerTube: Administrator, Moderator, and User. See the [roles guide](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/admin/managing-users#roles) for a detail of their permissions.

    # Errors

    The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure
    of the API call, completed by a [RFC7807-compliant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) response body.

    ```
    HTTP 1.1 404 Not Found
    Content-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8

    {
      "detail": "Video not found",
      "docs": "https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo",
      "status": 404,
      "title": "Not Found",
      "type": "about:blank"
    }
    ```

    We provide error `type` (following RFC7807) and `code` (internal PeerTube code) values for [a growing number of cases](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/develop/packages/models/src/server/server-error-code.enum.ts),
    but it is still optional. Types are used to disambiguate errors that bear the same status code
    and are non-obvious:

    ```
    HTTP 1.1 403 Forbidden
    Content-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8

    {
      "detail": "Cannot get this video regarding follow constraints",
      "docs": "https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo",
      "status": 403,
      "title": "Forbidden",
      "type": "https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#section/Errors/does_not_respect_follow_constraints"
    }
    ```

    Here a 403 error could otherwise mean that the video is private or blocklisted.

    ### Validation errors

    Each parameter is evaluated on its own against a set of rules before the route validator
    proceeds with potential testing involving parameter combinations. Errors coming from validation
    errors appear earlier and benefit from a more detailed error description:

    ```
    HTTP 1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8

    {
      "detail": "Incorrect request parameters: id",
      "docs": "https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo",
      "instance": "/api/v1/videos/9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180",
      "invalid-params": {
        "id": {
          "location": "params",
          "msg": "Invalid value",
          "param": "id",
          "value": "9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180"
        }
      },
      "status": 400,
      "title": "Bad Request",
      "type": "about:blank"
    }
    ```

    Where `id` is the name of the field concerned by the error, within the route definition.
    `invalid-params.<field>.location` can be either 'params', 'body', 'header', 'query' or 'cookies', and
    `invalid-params.<field>.value` reports the value that didn't pass validation whose `invalid-params.<field>.msg`
    is about.

    ### Deprecated error fields

    Some fields could be included with previous versions. They are still included but their use is deprecated:
    - `error`: superseded by `detail`

    # Rate limits

    We are rate-limiting all endpoints of PeerTube's API. Custom values can be set by administrators:

    | Endpoint (prefix: `/api/v1`) | Calls         | Time frame   |
    |------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
    | `/*`                         | 50            | 10 seconds   |
    | `POST /users/token`          | 15            | 5 minutes    |
    | `POST /users/register`       | 2<sup>*</sup> | 5 minutes    |
    | `POST /users/ask-send-verify-email` | 3      | 5 minutes    |

    Depending on the endpoint, <sup>*</sup>failed requests are not taken into account. A service
    limit is announced by a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.

    You can get details about the current state of your rate limit by reading the
    following headers:

    | Header                  | Description                                                |
    |-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | Number of max requests allowed in the current time period  |
    | `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Number of remaining requests in the current time period    |
    | `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | Timestamp of end of current time period as UNIX timestamp  |
    | `Retry-After`           | Seconds to delay after the first `429` is received         |

    # CORS

    This API features [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/),
    allowing cross-domain communication from the browser for some routes:

    | Endpoint                    |
    |------------------------- ---|
    | `/api/*`                    |
    | `/download/*`               |
    | `/lazy-static/*`            |
    | `/.well-known/webfinger`    |

    In addition, all routes serving ActivityPub are CORS-enabled for all origins.

    Managing servers which the instance interacts with is crucial to the concept of federation in PeerTube and external video indexation. The PeerTube server then deals with inter-server ActivityPub operations and propagates information across its social graph by posting activities to actors' inbox endpoints.

    Operations dealing with adding video or audio. PeerTube supports two upload modes, and three import modes.

    ### Upload

    - [_legacy_](#operation/uploadLegacy), where the video file is sent in a single request
    - [_resumable_](#operation/uploadResumableInit), where the video file is sent in chunks

    You can upload videos more reliably by using the resumable variant. Its protocol lets
    you resume an upload operation after a network interruption or other transmission failure,
    saving time and bandwidth in the event of network failures.

    Favor using resumable uploads in any of the following cases:
    - You are transferring large files
    - The likelihood of a network interruption is high
    - Uploads are originating from a device with a low-bandwidth or unstable Internet connection,
      such as a mobile device

    ### Import

    - _URL_-based: where the URL points to any service supported by [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/)
    - _magnet_-based: where the URI resolves to a BitTorrent resource containing a single supported video file
    - _torrent_-based: where the metainfo file resolves to a BitTorrent resource containing a single supported video file

    The import function is practical when the desired video/audio is available online. It makes PeerTube
    download it for you, saving you as much bandwidth and avoiding any instability or limitation your network might have.

    The search helps to find _videos_ or _channels_ from within the instance and beyond.
    Videos from other instances federated by the instance (that is, instances
    followed by the instance) can be found via keywords and other criteria of
    the advanced search.

    Administrators can also enable the use of a remote search system, indexing

                        <p>@stemy@mas.to Merci pour cette source que je vais aller lire. L'anxiété liée au climat est souvent perçue comme un problème de riches par ceux qui y contribuent le moins (à la dégradation climatique) et qui en souffrent déjà le plus. Il y a là un paradoxe assez douloureux (j'ai trouvé beaucoup d'intérêt au le travail de J.B.Comby sur ce sujet). Mais il n'y a pas de raison que simultanément ils ne souffrent pas de cette anxiété majorée d'un sentiment d'absence de choix.</p>

                    <p>« Si j’avais su que j’aurais un jour une histoire, je l’aurais choisie, j’aurais vécu avec plus de soin pour la faire belle et vraie en vue de me plaire. Maintenant, c’est trop tard » :  Denis Robert cite Marguerite Duras en exergue de son édito de janvier pour mieux s’interroger sur le sens de ce que nous entreprenons à Blast, dans les médias… et sur la planète. Duras, mais aussi Cavanna et David Lynch. On avance en eau trouble, poussé par ces esprits sereins. Comment retrouver une vie tranquille ? Comment surmonter les fractures post Charlie? Comment lutter contre la montée du nazisme et des fake news (qui avancent ensemble)?<br />
                    L'édito brasse large et remonte au 11 septembre 2001, moment de bascule, pour très vite arriver aux attentats de 2015 et à Charlie. En être ou pas. Telle était et est toujours la question. Un édito assez sombre mais pas cafardeux, car à la fin, l’ami de la bande à Charlie Hebdo, biberonné par Choron and cie, nous livre un rayon d’optimisme : « La bataille va être rude, mais rien n’est perdu même si les vents contraire soufflent fort. Entre eux et nous, il y a la réalité du terrain. Je pense qu’ils s’en foutent de la réalité. Les 70 ou 80 000 morts de Gaza, comme le comptabilise cette semaine la revue scientifique The Lancet ne les préoccupe pas. L’histoire de la Palestine non plus. Ils ne voient rien, aveuglés qu’ils sont par leur croyance et leur esprit belliqueux. Il faut tenir bon, revenir au réel toujours. Et avoir confiance en l’avenir. Il est imprévisible. Tout peut arriver et le meilleur n’est pas à exclure. »  Allez salut, et vive Blast.</p>

                                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soutenez Blast, nouveau média indépendant : <a href="https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir</a></p>
                    <p>Donald Trump est officiellement à nouveau président des Etats-Unis et il est plus puissant que jamais. 8 ans après sa première élection, c’est une toute nouvelle ère qui s’ouvre pour le pays mais aussi pour le monde. L’ère où tout peut basculer.<br />
                    Cela pourrait presque être le scénario d’une série de science-fiction. Donald Trump revient à la Maison Blanche en compagnie d’Elon Musk, l’homme le plus riche au monde mais aussi de toute une clique de milliardaires et millionnaires, de géants de la tech qui ont façonné le monde dans lequel nous vivons. Désormais complices de l’extrême droite, ils mettent en danger notre planète, notre vie privée, nos démocraties et ne cachent pas leur masculinisme. Les conflits d’intérêts sont partout. Et la ploutocratie, ce pouvoir exercé par les plus riches, n’a jamais été aussi évidente, certains parlent même d’une broligarchie en référence aux bros, les frères qui se serrent les coudes pour former un boys club de milliardaire au pouvoir. En clair, l’ultra capitalisme et les libertariens partent à l’assaut de la démocratie et de l’”Etat profond”.<br />
                    De nombreux experts s’accordent à dire que l’Etat de droit est menacé aux Etats Unis. Et tout ceci, donne l'impression que c’est une certaine vision de la société qui est en train de gagner.<br />
                    Un nouveau chapitre de l’histoire mondiale s'ouvre donc plein d’incertitudes. Car cette politique nous concerne aussi. La souveraineté même de l'Union européenne est mise en danger par l’ingérence d’Elon Musk et de Donald Trump. Avec ce second mandat, le saut dans le vide est complet et le ton a déjà été donné.</p>
                    <p>À l’heure où beaucoup se demandent qui a le plus de pouvoir entre Donald Trump et Elon Musk, Paloma Moritz vous propose de prendre un peu de recul pour comprendre ce qu’il se joue actuellement aux Etats-Unis et ses conséquences pour le monde.</p>

                    <p>Après plus d’un an et demi de destruction de Gaza et d’anéantissement de sa population par Israël, un accord de cessez-le-feu a été conclu le 17 janvier 2025. Célébré par les Gazaouis comme une libération, s’il est respecté, il restera désormais tout à reconstruire à Gaza.</p>
                    <p>Infrastructures détruites, déplacement forcé de population, nettoyage ethnique tout ceci à mener Israël à commettre un génocide l’encontre des palestiniens. Alors l’État hébreu va-t-il être sanctionné pour ses crimes ?  Les responsables politiques, notamment le premier ministre Netanyahu, peuvent-ils être inquiétés par la justice internationale ?</p>
                    <p>Pour en parler, Blast reçoit Francesca Albanese, rapporteuse spéciale des Nations Unies sur la situation des droits de l’homme dans les territoires palestiniens occupés depuis 1967.</p>
                    <p>Elle a produit des rapports et a alerté à de nombreuses reprises sur ce génocide qu’elle qualifie de nature coloniale.</p>

                                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soutenez Blast, nouveau média indépendant : <a href="https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir</a></p>
                    <p>« Si j’avais su que j’aurais un jour une histoire, je l’aurais choisie, j’aurais vécu avec plus de soin pour la faire belle et vraie en vue de me plaire. Maintenant, c’est trop tard » :  Denis Robert cite Marguerite Duras en exergue de son édito de janvier pour mieux s’interroger sur le sens de ce que nous entreprenons à Blast, dans les médias… et sur la planète. Duras, mais aussi Cavanna et David Lynch. On avance en eau trouble, poussé par ces esprits sereins. Comment retrouver une vie tranquille ? Comment surmonter les fractures post Charlie? Comment lutter contre la montée du nazisme et des fake news (qui avancent ensemble)?<br />
                    L'édito brasse large et remonte au 11 septembre 2001, moment de bascule, pour très vite arriver aux attentats de 2015 et à Charlie. En être ou pas. Telle était et est toujours la question. Un édito assez sombre mais pas cafardeux, car à la fin, l’ami de la bande à Charlie Hebdo, biberonné par Choron and cie, nous livre un rayon d’optimisme : « La bataille va être rude, mais rien n’est perdu même si les vents contraire soufflent fort. Entre eux et nous, il y a la réalité du terrain. Je pense qu’ils s’en foutent de la réalité. Les 70 ou 80 000 morts de Gaza, comme le comptabilise cette semaine la revue scientifique The Lancet ne les préoccupe pas. L’histoire de la Palestine non plus. Ils ne voient rien, aveuglés qu’ils sont par leur croyance et leur esprit belliqueux. Il faut tenir bon, revenir au réel toujours. Et avoir confiance en l’avenir. Il est imprévisible. Tout peut arriver et le meilleur n’est pas à exclure. »  Allez salut, et vive Blast.</p>

                                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soutenez Blast, nouveau média indépendant : <a href="https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir</a></p>
                    <p>Donald Trump est officiellement à nouveau président des Etats-Unis et il est plus puissant que jamais. 8 ans après sa première élection, c’est une toute nouvelle ère qui s’ouvre pour le pays mais aussi pour le monde. L’ère où tout peut basculer.<br />
                    Cela pourrait presque être le scénario d’une série de science-fiction. Donald Trump revient à la Maison Blanche en compagnie d’Elon Musk, l’homme le plus riche au monde mais aussi de toute une clique de milliardaires et millionnaires, de géants de la tech qui ont façonné le monde dans lequel nous vivons. Désormais complices de l’extrême droite, ils mettent en danger notre planète, notre vie privée, nos démocraties et ne cachent pas leur masculinisme. Les conflits d’intérêts sont partout. Et la ploutocratie, ce pouvoir exercé par les plus riches, n’a jamais été aussi évidente, certains parlent même d’une broligarchie en référence aux bros, les frères qui se serrent les coudes pour former un boys club de milliardaire au pouvoir. En clair, l’ultra capitalisme et les libertariens partent à l’assaut de la démocratie et de l’”Etat profond”.<br />
                    De nombreux experts s’accordent à dire que l’Etat de droit est menacé aux Etats Unis. Et tout ceci, donne l'impression que c’est une certaine vision de la société qui est en train de gagner.<br />
                    Un nouveau chapitre de l’histoire mondiale s'ouvre donc plein d’incertitudes. Car cette politique nous concerne aussi. La souveraineté même de l'Union européenne est mise en danger par l’ingérence d’Elon Musk et de Donald Trump. Avec ce second mandat, le saut dans le vide est complet et le ton a déjà été donné.</p>
                    <p>À l’heure où beaucoup se demandent qui a le plus de pouvoir entre Donald Trump et Elon Musk, Paloma Moritz vous propose de prendre un peu de recul pour comprendre ce qu’il se joue actuellement aux Etats-Unis et ses conséquences pour le monde.</p>

                    <p>Après plus d’un an et demi de destruction de Gaza et d’anéantissement de sa population par Israël, un accord de cessez-le-feu a été conclu le 17 janvier 2025. Célébré par les Gazaouis comme une libération, s’il est respecté, il restera désormais tout à reconstruire à Gaza.</p>
                    <p>Infrastructures détruites, déplacement forcé de population, nettoyage ethnique tout ceci à mener Israël à commettre un génocide l’encontre des palestiniens. Alors l’État hébreu va-t-il être sanctionné pour ses crimes ?  Les responsables politiques, notamment le premier ministre Netanyahu, peuvent-ils être inquiétés par la justice internationale ?</p>
                    <p>Pour en parler, Blast reçoit Francesca Albanese, rapporteuse spéciale des Nations Unies sur la situation des droits de l’homme dans les territoires palestiniens occupés depuis 1967.</p>
                    <p>Elle a produit des rapports et a alerté à de nombreuses reprises sur ce génocide qu’elle qualifie de nature coloniale.</p>

Lundi 20 janvier, l’application CBP One, lancée par l’administration Biden pour leur permettre de prendre un rendez-vous afin de déposer leur demande d’asile avant d’entrer aux Etats-Unis, a cessé de fonctionner. Cela a déclenché des scènes de désespoir du côté mexicain de la frontière, où beaucoup ont découvert l’annulation de leurs rendez-vous.</p>

                                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soutenez Blast, nouveau média indépendant : <a href="https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir</a></p>
                    <p>« Si j’avais su que j’aurais un jour une histoire, je l’aurais choisie, j’aurais vécu avec plus de soin pour la faire belle et vraie en vue de me plaire. Maintenant, c’est trop tard » :  Denis Robert cite Marguerite Duras en exergue de son édito de janvier pour mieux s’interroger sur le sens de ce que nous entreprenons à Blast, dans les médias… et sur la planète. Duras, mais aussi Cavanna et David Lynch. On avance en eau trouble, poussé par ces esprits sereins. Comment retrouver une vie tranquille ? Comment surmonter les fractures post Charlie? Comment lutter contre la montée du nazisme et des fake news (qui avancent ensemble)?<br />
                    L'édito brasse large et remonte au 11 septembre 2001, moment de bascule, pour très vite arriver aux attentats de 2015 et à Charlie. En être ou pas. Telle était et est toujours la question. Un édito assez sombre mais pas cafardeux, car à la fin, l’ami de la bande à Charlie Hebdo, biberonné par Choron and cie, nous livre un rayon d’optimisme : « La bataille va être rude, mais rien n’est perdu même si les vents contraire soufflent fort. Entre eux et nous, il y a la réalité du terrain. Je pense qu’ils s’en foutent de la réalité. Les 70 ou 80 000 morts de Gaza, comme le comptabilise cette semaine la revue scientifique The Lancet ne les préoccupe pas. L’histoire de la Palestine non plus. Ils ne voient rien, aveuglés qu’ils sont par leur croyance et leur esprit belliqueux. Il faut tenir bon, revenir au réel toujours. Et avoir confiance en l’avenir. Il est imprévisible. Tout peut arriver et le meilleur n’est pas à exclure. »  Allez salut, et vive Blast.</p>

                                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soutenez Blast, nouveau média indépendant : <a href="https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir</a></p>
                    <p>Donald Trump est officiellement à nouveau président des Etats-Unis et il est plus puissant que jamais. 8 ans après sa première élection, c’est une toute nouvelle ère qui s’ouvre pour le pays mais aussi pour le monde. L’ère où tout peut basculer.<br />
                    Cela pourrait presque être le scénario d’une série de science-fiction. Donald Trump revient à la Maison Blanche en compagnie d’Elon Musk, l’homme le plus riche au monde mais aussi de toute une clique de milliardaires et millionnaires, de géants de la tech qui ont façonné le monde dans lequel nous vivons. Désormais complices de l’extrême droite, ils mettent en danger notre planète, notre vie privée, nos démocraties et ne cachent pas leur masculinisme. Les conflits d’intérêts sont partout. Et la ploutocratie, ce pouvoir exercé par les plus riches, n’a jamais été aussi évidente, certains parlent même d’une broligarchie en référence aux bros, les frères qui se serrent les coudes pour former un boys club de milliardaire au pouvoir. En clair, l’ultra capitalisme et les libertariens partent à l’assaut de la démocratie et de l’”Etat profond”.<br />
                    De nombreux experts s’accordent à dire que l’Etat de droit est menacé aux Etats Unis. Et tout ceci, donne l'impression que c’est une certaine vision de la société qui est en train de gagner.<br />
                    Un nouveau chapitre de l’histoire mondiale s'ouvre donc plein d’incertitudes. Car cette politique nous concerne aussi. La souveraineté même de l'Union européenne est mise en danger par l’ingérence d’Elon Musk et de Donald Trump. Avec ce second mandat, le saut dans le vide est complet et le ton a déjà été donné.</p>
                    <p>À l’heure où beaucoup se demandent qui a le plus de pouvoir entre Donald Trump et Elon Musk, Paloma Moritz vous propose de prendre un peu de recul pour comprendre ce qu’il se joue actuellement aux Etats-Unis et ses conséquences pour le monde.</p>

                    <p>Après plus d’un an et demi de destruction de Gaza et d’anéantissement de sa population par Israël, un accord de cessez-le-feu a été conclu le 17 janvier 2025. Célébré par les Gazaouis comme une libération, s’il est respecté, il restera désormais tout à reconstruire à Gaza.</p>
                    <p>Infrastructures détruites, déplacement forcé de population, nettoyage ethnique tout ceci à mener Israël à commettre un génocide l’encontre des palestiniens. Alors l’État hébreu va-t-il être sanctionné pour ses crimes ?  Les responsables politiques, notamment le premier ministre Netanyahu, peuvent-ils être inquiétés par la justice internationale ?</p>
                    <p>Pour en parler, Blast reçoit Francesca Albanese, rapporteuse spéciale des Nations Unies sur la situation des droits de l’homme dans les territoires palestiniens occupés depuis 1967.</p>
                    <p>Elle a produit des rapports et a alerté à de nombreuses reprises sur ce génocide qu’elle qualifie de nature coloniale.</p>

                    <p>« Si j’avais su que j’aurais un jour une histoire, je l’aurais choisie, j’aurais vécu avec plus de soin pour la faire belle et vraie en vue de me plaire. Maintenant, c’est trop tard » :  Denis Robert cite Marguerite Duras en exergue de son édito de janvier pour mieux s’interroger sur le sens de ce que nous entreprenons à Blast, dans les médias… et sur la planète. Duras, mais aussi Cavanna et David Lynch. On avance en eau trouble, poussé par ces esprits sereins. Comment retrouver une vie tranquille ? Comment surmonter les fractures post Charlie? Comment lutter contre la montée du nazisme et des fake news (qui avancent ensemble)?<br />
                    L'édito brasse large et remonte au 11 septembre 2001, moment de bascule, pour très vite arriver aux attentats de 2015 et à Charlie. En être ou pas. Telle était et est toujours la question. Un édito assez sombre mais pas cafardeux, car à la fin, l’ami de la bande à Charlie Hebdo, biberonné par Choron and cie, nous livre un rayon d’optimisme : « La bataille va être rude, mais rien n’est perdu même si les vents contraire soufflent fort. Entre eux et nous, il y a la réalité du terrain. Je pense qu’ils s’en foutent de la réalité. Les 70 ou 80 000 morts de Gaza, comme le comptabilise cette semaine la revue scientifique The Lancet ne les préoccupe pas. L’histoire de la Palestine non plus. Ils ne voient rien, aveuglés qu’ils sont par leur croyance et leur esprit belliqueux. Il faut tenir bon, revenir au réel toujours. Et avoir confiance en l’avenir. Il est imprévisible. Tout peut arriver et le meilleur n’est pas à exclure. »  Allez salut, et vive Blast.</p>

                            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Soutenez Blast, nouveau média indépendant : <a href="https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir</a></p>
                    <p>Donald Trump est officiellement à nouveau président des Etats-Unis et il est plus puissant que jamais. 8 ans après sa première élection, c’est une toute nouvelle ère qui s’ouvre pour le pays mais aussi pour le monde. L’ère où tout peut basculer.<br />
                    Cela pourrait presque être le scénario d’une série de science-fiction. Donald Trump revient à la Maison Blanche en compagnie d’Elon Musk, l’homme le plus riche au monde mais aussi de toute une clique de milliardaires et millionnaires, de géants de la tech qui ont façonné le monde dans lequel nous vivons. Désormais complices de l’extrême droite, ils mettent en danger notre planète, notre vie privée, nos démocraties et ne cachent pas leur masculinisme. Les conflits d’intérêts sont partout. Et la ploutocratie, ce pouvoir exercé par les plus riches, n’a jamais été aussi évidente, certains parlent même d’une broligarchie en référence aux bros, les frères qui se serrent les coudes pour former un boys club de milliardaire au pouvoir. En clair, l’ultra capitalisme et les libertariens partent à l’assaut de la démocratie et de l’”Etat profond”.<br />
                    De nombreux experts s’accordent à dire que l’Etat de droit est menacé aux Etats Unis. Et tout ceci, donne l'impression que c’est une certaine vision de la société qui est en train de gagner.<br />
                    Un nouveau chapitre de l’histoire mondiale s'ouvre donc plein d’incertitudes. Car cette politique nous concerne aussi. La souveraineté même de l'Union européenne est mise en danger par l’ingérence d’Elon Musk et de Donald Trump. Avec ce second mandat, le saut dans le vide est complet et le ton a déjà été donné.</p>
                    <p>À l’heure où beaucoup se demandent qui a le plus de pouvoir entre Donald Trump et Elon Musk, Paloma Moritz vous propose de prendre un peu de recul pour comprendre ce qu’il se joue actuellement aux Etats-Unis et ses conséquences pour le monde.</p>

                    <p>Après plus d’un an et demi de destruction de Gaza et d’anéantissement de sa population par Israël, un accord de cessez-le-feu a été conclu le 17 janvier 2025. Célébré par les Gazaouis comme une libération, s’il est respecté, il restera désormais tout à reconstruire à Gaza.</p>
                    <p>Infrastructures détruites, déplacement forcé de population, nettoyage ethnique tout ceci à mener Israël à commettre un génocide l’encontre des palestiniens. Alors l’État hébreu va-t-il être sanctionné pour ses crimes ?  Les responsables politiques, notamment le premier ministre Netanyahu, peuvent-ils être inquiétés par la justice internationale ?</p>
                    <p>Pour en parler, Blast reçoit Francesca Albanese, rapporteuse spéciale des Nations Unies sur la situation des droits de l’homme dans les territoires palestiniens occupés depuis 1967.</p>
                    <p>Elle a produit des rapports et a alerté à de nombreuses reprises sur ce génocide qu’elle qualifie de nature coloniale.</p>

Lundi 20 janvier, l’application CBP One, lancée par l’administration Biden pour leur permettre de prendre un rendez-vous afin de déposer leur demande d’asile avant d’entrer aux Etats-Unis, a cessé de fonctionner. Cela a déclenché des scènes de désespoir du côté mexicain de la frontière, où beaucoup ont découvert l’annulation de leurs rendez-vous.</p>

                        <p>« Si j’avais su que j’aurais un jour une histoire, je l’aurais choisie, j’aurais vécu avec plus de soin pour la faire belle et vraie en vue de me plaire. Maintenant, c’est trop tard » :  Denis Robert cite Marguerite Duras en exergue de son édito de janvier pour mieux s’interroger sur le sens de ce que nous entreprenons à Blast, dans les médias… et sur la planète. Duras, mais aussi Cavanna et David Lynch. On avance en eau trouble, poussé par ces esprits sereins. Comment retrouver une vie tranquille ? Comment surmonter les fractures post Charlie? Comment lutter contre la montée du nazisme et des fake news (qui avancent ensemble)?<br />
                        L'édito brasse large et remonte au 11 septembre 2001, moment de bascule, pour très vite arriver aux attentats de 2015 et à Charlie. En être ou pas. Telle était et est toujours la question. Un édito assez sombre mais pas cafardeux, car à la fin, l’ami de la bande à Charlie Hebdo, biberonné par Choron and cie, nous livre un rayon d’optimisme : « La bataille va être rude, mais rien n’est perdu même si les vents contraire soufflent fort. Entre eux et nous, il y a la réalité du terrain. Je pense qu’ils s’en foutent de la réalité. Les 70 ou 80 000 morts de Gaza, comme le comptabilise cette semaine la revue scientifique The Lancet ne les préoccupe pas. L’histoire de la Palestine non plus. Ils ne voient rien, aveuglés qu’ils sont par leur croyance et leur esprit belliqueux. Il faut tenir bon, revenir au réel toujours. Et avoir confiance en l’avenir. Il est imprévisible. Tout peut arriver et le meilleur n’est pas à exclure. »  Allez salut, et vive Blast.</p>

                        <p>Soutenez Blast, nouveau média indépendant : <a href="https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.blast-info.fr/soutenir</a></p>
                        <p>Donald Trump est officiellement à nouveau président des Etats-Unis et il est plus puissant que jamais. 8 ans après sa première élection, c’est une toute nouvelle ère qui s’ouvre pour le pays mais aussi pour le monde. L’ère où tout peut basculer.<br />
                        Cela pourrait presque être le scénario d’une série de science-fiction. Donald Trump revient à la Maison Blanche en compagnie d’Elon Musk, l’homme le plus riche au monde mais aussi de toute une clique de milliardaires et millionnaires, de géants de la tech qui ont façonné le monde dans lequel nous vivons. Désormais complices de l’extrême droite, ils mettent en danger notre planète, notre vie privée, nos démocraties et ne cachent pas leur masculinisme. Les conflits d’intérêts sont partout. Et la ploutocratie, ce pouvoir exercé par les plus riches, n’a jamais été aussi évidente, certains parlent même d’une broligarchie en référence aux bros, les frères qui se serrent les coudes pour former un boys club de milliardaire au pouvoir. En clair, l’ultra capitalisme et les libertariens partent à l’assaut de la démocratie et de l’”Etat profond”.<br />
                        De nombreux experts s’accordent à dire que l’Etat de droit est menacé aux Etats Unis. Et tout ceci, donne l'impression que c’est une certaine vision de la société qui est en train de gagner.<br />
                        Un nouveau chapitre de l’histoire mondiale s'ouvre donc plein d’incertitudes. Car cette politique nous concerne aussi. La souveraineté même de l'Union européenne est mise en danger par l’ingérence d’Elon Musk et de Donald Trump. Avec ce second mandat, le saut dans le vide est complet et le ton a déjà été donné.</p>
                        <p>À l’heure où beaucoup se demandent qui a le plus de pouvoir entre Donald Trump et Elon Musk, Paloma Moritz vous propose de prendre un peu de recul pour comprendre ce qu’il se joue actuellement aux Etats-Unis et ses conséquences pour le monde.</p>

                        <p>Après plus d’un an et demi de destruction de Gaza et d’anéantissement de sa population par Israël, un accord de cessez-le-feu a été conclu le 17 janvier 2025. Célébré par les Gazaouis comme une libération, s’il est respecté, il restera désormais tout à reconstruire à Gaza.</p>
                        <p>Infrastructures détruites, déplacement forcé de population, nettoyage ethnique tout ceci à mener Israël à commettre un génocide l’encontre des palestiniens. Alors l’État hébreu va-t-il être sanctionné pour ses crimes ?  Les responsables politiques, notamment le premier ministre Netanyahu, peuvent-ils être inquiétés par la justice internationale ?</p>
                        <p>Pour en parler, Blast reçoit Francesca Albanese, rapporteuse spéciale des Nations Unies sur la situation des droits de l’homme dans les territoires palestiniens occupés depuis 1967.</p>
                        <p>Elle a produit des rapports et a alerté à de nombreuses reprises sur ce génocide qu’elle qualifie de nature coloniale.</p>

        **Warning**: If you choose to make an index search, PeerTube will get results from a third party service. It means the instance may not yet know the objects you fetched. If you want to load video/channel information:
          * If the current user has the ability to make a remote URI search (this information is available in the config endpoint),
          then reuse the search API to make a search using the object URI so PeerTube instance fetches the remote object and fill its database.
          After that, you can use the classic REST API endpoints to fetch the complete object or interact with it
          * If the current user doesn't have the ability to make a remote URI search, then redirect the user on the origin instance or fetch
          the data from the origin instance API

        Authenticating via OAuth requires the following steps:
        - Have an activated account
        - [Generate] an access token for that account at `/api/v1/users/token`.
        - Make requests with the *Authorization: Bearer <token\>* header
        - Profit, depending on the role assigned to the account

        Note that the __access token is valid for 1 day__ and is given
        along with a __refresh token valid for 2 weeks__.
